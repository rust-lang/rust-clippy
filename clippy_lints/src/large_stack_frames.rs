    /// ### What it does
    /// Checks for functions that use a lot of stack space.
    ///
    /// This often happens when constructing a large type, such as an array with a lot of elements,
    /// or constructing *many* smaller-but-still-large structs, or copying around a lot of large types.
    ///
    /// This lint is a more general version of [`large_stack_arrays`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#large_stack_arrays)
    /// that is intended to look at functions as a whole instead of only individual array expressions inside of a function.
    ///
    /// ### Why is this bad?
    /// The stack region of memory is very limited in size (usually *much* smaller than the heap) and attempting to
    /// use too much will result in a stack overflow and crash the program.
    /// To avoid this, you should consider allocating large types on the heap instead (e.g. by boxing them).
    ///
    /// Keep in mind that the code path to construction of large types does not even need to be reachable;
    /// it purely needs to *exist* inside of the function to contribute to the stack size.
    /// For example, this causes a stack overflow even though the branch is unreachable:
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// fn main() {
    ///     if false {
    ///         let x = [0u8; 10000000]; // 10 MB stack array
    ///         black_box(&x);
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ### Known issues
    /// False positives. The stack size that clippy sees is an estimated value and can be vastly different
    /// from the actual stack usage after optimizations passes have run (especially true in release mode).
    /// Modern compilers are very smart and are able to optimize away a lot of unnecessary stack allocations.
    /// In debug mode however, it is usually more accurate.
    ///
    /// This lint works by summing up the size of all variables that the user typed, variables that were
    /// implicitly introduced by the compiler for temporaries, function arguments and the return value,
    /// and comparing them against a (configurable, but high-by-default).
    ///
    /// ### Example
    /// This function creates four 500 KB arrays on the stack. Quite big but just small enough to not trigger `large_stack_arrays`.
    /// However, looking at the function as a whole, it's clear that this uses a lot of stack space.
    /// ```no_run
    /// struct QuiteLargeType([u8; 500_000]);
    /// fn foo() {
    ///     // ... some function that uses a lot of stack space ...
    ///     let _x1 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);
    ///     let _x2 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);
    ///     let _x3 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);
    ///     let _x4 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Instead of doing this, allocate the arrays on the heap.
    /// This currently requires going through a `Vec` first and then converting it to a `Box`:
    /// ```no_run
    /// struct NotSoLargeType(Box<[u8]>);
    ///
    /// fn foo() {
    ///     let _x1 = NotSoLargeType(vec![0; 500_000].into_boxed_slice());
    /// //                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Now heap allocated.
    /// //                                                                The size of `NotSoLargeType` is 16 bytes.
    /// //  ...
    /// }
    /// ```
