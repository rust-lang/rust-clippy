# Adding Documentation for New Lint

Assuming that our dear reader has read all the previous chapters
on development in Clippy, the final thing to do when authoring a
new lint or updating an existing lint is to write or edit the
lint decalaration's documentation.

You might have come across [Clippy lints list][lint_list] and
read about a few lints that you want to use, restrict, or understand.

These lints's documentation is generated by using the `declare_clippy_lint`
macro and by writing the documentation inside:

```rust
declare_clippy_lint! {
    /// ### What it does
    /// Checks for ... (describe what the lint matches).
    ///
    /// ### Why is this bad?
    /// Supply the reason for linting the code.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    ///
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// // A short example of code that triggers the lint
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Use instead:
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// // A short example of improved code that doesn't trigger the lint
    /// ```
    #[clippy::version = "1.64.0"]
    pub FOO_FUNCTIONS,
    pedantic,
    "function named `foo`, which is not a descriptive name"
}
```

Make sure you put some love into writing a good documentation so that
other Clippy users can understand the awesome lint that you just created.

Once the PR to your lint is merged, this documentation will show up in the
[lint list][lint_list]. Pat yourself on the shoulder and be proud that
you have made Rust that extra little bit more awesome for the world!
