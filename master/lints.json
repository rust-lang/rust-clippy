This is generally considered unidiomatic, and you\nshould add a `use` statement.\n\nThe default maximum segments (2) is pretty strict, you may want to increase this in\n`clippy.toml`.\n\nNote: One exception to this is code from macro expansion - this does not lint such cases, as\nusing absolute paths is the proper way of referencing items in one.\n\n### Example\n```rust\nlet x = std::f64::consts::PI;\n```\nUse any of the below instead, or anything else:\n```rust\nuse std::f64;\nuse std::f64::consts;\nuse std::f64::consts::PI;\nlet x = f64::consts::PI;\nlet x = consts::PI;\nlet x = PI;\nuse std::f64::consts as f64_consts;\nlet x = f64_consts::PI;\n```\n\n### Configuration\nThis lint has the following configuration variables:\n\n- `absolute-paths-allowed-crates`: Which crates to allow absolute paths from (default: `[]`)- `absolute-paths-max-segments`: The maximum number of segments a path can have before being linted, anything above this will\n   be linted.

In this case the use of `const` is legit,\nand this lint should be suppressed.\n\nEven though the lint avoids triggering on a constant whose type has enums that have variants\nwith interior mutability, and its value uses non interior mutable variants (see\n[#3962](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/3962) and\n[#3825](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/3825) for examples);\nit complains about associated constants without default values only based on its types;\nwhich might not be preferable.\nThere're other enums plus associated constants cases that the lint cannot handle.\n\nTypes that have underlying or potential interior mutability trigger the lint whether\nthe interior mutable field is used or not. See issue\n[#5812](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/5812)\n\n### Example\n```rust\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering::SeqCst};\n\nconst CONST_ATOM: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(12);\nCONST_ATOM.store(6, SeqCst); // the content of the atomic is unchanged\nassert_eq!(CONST_ATOM.load(SeqCst), 12); // because the CONST_ATOM in these lines are distinct\n```\n\nUse instead:\n```rust\nstatic STATIC_ATOM: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(15);\nSTATIC_ATOM.store(9, SeqCst);\nassert_eq!(STATIC_ATOM.load(SeqCst), 9); // use a `static` item to refer to the same instance\n```\n\n### Configuration\nThis lint has the following configuration variables:\n\n- `ignore-interior-mutability`: A list of paths to types that should be treated as if they do not contain interior mutability (default: `[\"bytes::Bytes\"]`)",

Lazy continuations makes\nunintended markers hard to see, and make it harder to deduce the\ndocument's intended structure.\n\n### Example\n\nThis table is probably intended to have two rows,\nbut it does not. It has zero rows, and is followed by\na block quote.\n```rust\n/// Range | Description\n/// ----- | -----------\n/// >= 1  | fully opaque\n/// < 1   | partially see-through\nfn set_opacity(opacity: f32) {}\n```\n\nFix it by escaping the marker:\n```rust\n/// Range | Description\n/// ----- | -----------\n/// \\>= 1 | fully opaque\n/// < 1   | partially see-through\nfn set_opacity(opacity: f32) {}\n```\n\nThis example is actually intended to be a list:\n```rust\n/// * Do nothing.\n/// * Then do something. Whatever it is needs done,\n/// it should be done right now.\n```\n\nFix it by indenting the list contents:\n```rust\n/// * Do nothing.\n/// * Then do something.

HTML elements and their\ncontent are not linted.\n\nIn addition, when writing documentation comments, including `[]` brackets\ninside a link text would trip the parser. Therefore, documenting link with\n`[`SmallVec<[T; INLINE_CAPACITY]>`]` and then [`SmallVec<[T; INLINE_CAPACITY]>`]: SmallVec\nwould fail.\n\n### Examples\n```rust\n/// Do something with the foo_bar parameter. See also\n/// that::other::module::foo.\n// ^ `foo_bar` and `that::other::module::foo` should be ticked.\nfn doit(foo_bar: usize) {}\n```\n\n```rust\n// Link text with `[]` brackets should be written as following:\n/// Consume the array and return the inner\n/// [`SmallVec<[T; INLINE_CAPACITY]>`][SmallVec].\n/// [SmallVec]: SmallVec\nfn main() {}\n```\n\n### Configuration\nThis lint has the following configuration variables:\n\n- `doc-valid-idents`: The list of words this lint should not consider as identifiers needing ticks. The value\n   `\"..\"` can be used as part of the list to indicate, that the configured values should be appended to the\n   default configuration of Clippy. By default, any configuration will replace the default value. For example:\n   * `doc-valid-idents = [\"ClipPy\"]` would replace the default list with `[\"ClipPy\"]`.\n   * `doc-valid-idents = [\"ClipPy\", \"..\"]` would append `ClipPy` to the default list.

For the example above, this should be written:\n```rust\nfn int_to_opcode(op: u8) -> Option<Opcode> {\n    (op < 4).then(|| unsafe { std::mem::transmute(op) })\n             ^^^^ ^^ `bool::then` only executes the closure if the condition is true!\n}\n```",

It is _almost always_ a better idea to `panic!` than to have\na busy loop.\n\nIf panicking isn't possible, think of the environment and either:\n  - block on something\n  - sleep the thread for some microseconds\n  - yield or pause the thread\n\nFor `std` targets, this can be done with\n[`std::thread::sleep`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.sleep.html)\nor [`std::thread::yield_now`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.yield_now.html).\n\nFor `no_std` targets, doing this is more complicated, especially because\n`#[panic_handler]`s can't panic. To stop/pause the thread, you will\nprobably need to invoke some target-specific intrinsic. Examples include:\n  - [`x86_64::instructions::hlt`](https://docs.rs/x86_64/0.12.2/x86_64/instructions/fn.hlt.html)\n  - [`cortex_m::asm::wfi`](https://docs.rs/cortex-m/0.6.3/cortex_m/asm/fn.wfi.html)\n\n### Example\n```rust\nloop {}\n```",

Generic code\ntypically uses `Borrow<T>` when it relies on the identical behavior of these additional trait\nimplementations. These traits will likely appear as additional trait bounds.\n\nIn particular `Eq`, `Ord` and `Hash` must be equivalent for borrowed and owned values:\n`x.borrow() == y.borrow()` should give the same result as `x == y`.\nIt follows then that the following equivalence must hold:\n`hash(x) == hash((x as Borrow<[u8]>).borrow()) == hash((x as Borrow<str>).borrow())`\n\nUnfortunately it doesn't hold as `hash(\"abc\") != hash(\"abc\".as_bytes())`.\nThis happens because the `Hash` impl for str passes an additional `0xFF` byte to\nthe hasher to avoid collisions. For example, given the tuples `(\"a\", \"bc\")`, and `(\"ab\", \"c\")`,\nthe two tuples would have the same hash value if the `0xFF` byte was not added.\n\n### Example\n\n```rust\nuse std::borrow::Borrow;\nuse std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};\n\nstruct ExampleType {\n    data: String\n}\n\nimpl Hash for ExampleType {\n    fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {\n        self.data.hash(state);\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Borrow<str> for ExampleType {\n    fn borrow(&self) -> &str {\n        &self.data\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Borrow<[u8]> for ExampleType {\n    fn borrow(&self) -> &[u8] {\n        self.data.as_bytes()\n    }\n}\n```\nAs a consequence, hashing a `&ExampleType` and hashing the result of the two\nborrows will result in different values.\n",

The stack size that clippy sees is an estimated value and can be vastly different\nfrom the actual stack usage after optimizations passes have run (especially true in release mode).\nModern compilers are very smart and are able to optimize away a lot of unnecessary stack allocations.\nIn debug mode however, it is usually more accurate.\n\nThis lint works by summing up the size of all variables that the user typed, variables that were\nimplicitly introduced by the compiler for temporaries, function arguments and the return value,\nand comparing them against a (configurable, but high-by-default).\n\n### Example\nThis function creates four 500 KB arrays on the stack. Quite big but just small enough to not trigger `large_stack_arrays`.\nHowever, looking at the function as a whole, it's clear that this uses a lot of stack space.\n```rust\nstruct QuiteLargeType([u8; 500_000]);\nfn foo() {\n    // ... some function that uses a lot of stack space ...\n    let _x1 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);\n    let _x2 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);\n    let _x3 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);\n    let _x4 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);\n}\n```\n\nInstead of doing this, allocate the arrays on the heap.\nThis currently requires going through a `Vec` first and then converting it to a `Box`:\n```rust\nstruct NotSoLargeType(Box<[u8]>);\n\nfn foo() {\n    let _x1 = NotSoLargeType(vec![0; 500_000].into_boxed_slice());\n//                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Now heap allocated.\n//                                                                The size of `NotSoLargeType` is 16 bytes.\n//  ...\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration\nThis lint has the following configuration variables:\n\n- `stack-size-threshold`: The maximum allowed stack size for functions in bytes (default: `512000`)",

Even\n> if you're doing a lot of insertion in the middle of the list, `RingBuf`\ncan still be better\n> because of how expensive it is to seek to the middle of a `LinkedList`.\n\n### Known problems\nFalse positives – the instances where using a\n`LinkedList` makes sense are few and far between, but they can still happen.\n\n### Example\n```rust\nlet x: LinkedList<usize> = LinkedList::new();\n```\n\n### Configuration\nThis lint has the following configuration variables:\n\n- `avoid-breaking-exported-api`: Suppress lints whenever the suggested change would cause breakage for other crates.

It is, in general, very difficult to predict how well\nthe optimizer will be able to elide bounds checks and it very much depends on\nthe surrounding code. For example, indexing into the slice yielded by the\n[`slice::chunks_exact`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.slice.html#method.chunks_exact)\niterator will likely have all of the bounds checks elided even without an assert\nif the `chunk_size` is a constant.\n\nAsserts are not tracked across function calls.

Functions can be inlined across\ncrates when that's profitable as long as any form of LTO is used. When LTO is disabled,\nfunctions that are not `#[inline]` cannot be inlined across crates. Certain types of crates\nmight intend for most of the methods in their public API to be able to be inlined across\ncrates even when LTO is disabled. For these types of crates, enabling this lint might make\nsense. It allows the crate to require all exported methods to be `#[inline]` by default, and\nthen opt out for specific methods where this might not make sense.\n\n### Example\n```rust\npub fn foo() {} // missing #[inline]\nfn ok() {} // ok\n#[inline] pub fn bar() {} // ok\n#[inline(always)] pub fn baz() {} // ok\n\npub trait Bar {\n  fn bar(); // ok\n  fn def_bar() {} // missing #[inline]\n}\n\nstruct Baz;\nimpl Baz {\n   fn private() {} // ok\n}\n\nimpl Bar for Baz {\n  fn bar() {} // ok - Baz is not exported\n}\n\npub struct PubBaz;\nimpl PubBaz {\n   fn private() {} // ok\n   pub fn not_private() {} // missing #[inline]\n}\n\nimpl Bar for PubBaz {\n   fn bar() {} // missing #[inline]\n   fn def_bar() {} // missing #[inline]\n}\n```",

This is also true for internal APIs, as it is easy to leak\nunsoundness.\n\n### Context\nIn Rust, an `unsafe {...}` block is used to indicate that the code in that\nsection has been verified in some way that the compiler can not. For a\nfunction that accepts a raw pointer then accesses the pointer's data, this is\ngenerally impossible as the incoming pointer could point anywhere, valid or\nnot. So, the signature should be marked `unsafe fn`: this indicates that the\nfunction's caller must provide some verification that the arguments it sends\nare valid (and then call the function within an `unsafe` block).\n\n### Known problems\n* It does not check functions recursively so if the pointer is passed to a\nprivate non-`unsafe` function which does the dereferencing, the lint won't\ntrigger (false negative).\n* It only checks for arguments whose type are raw pointers, not raw pointers\ngot from an argument in some other way (`fn foo(bar: &[*const u8])` or\n`some_argument.get_raw_ptr()`) (false negative).\n\n### Example\n```rust\npub fn foo(x: *const u8) {\n    println!(\"{}\", unsafe { *x });\n}\n\n// this call \"looks\" safe but will segfault or worse!\n// foo(invalid_ptr);\n```\n\nUse instead:\n```rust\npub unsafe fn foo(x: *const u8) {\n    println!(\"{}\", unsafe { *x });\n}\n\n// this would cause a compiler error for calling without `unsafe`\n// foo(invalid_ptr);\n\n// sound call if the caller knows the pointer is valid\nunsafe { foo(valid_ptr); }\n```",

For example, `\\033`\nstands for the ASCII character 27 (ESC).

Rather, `ends_with` compares the given argument\nto the last **component** of the path and checks if it matches exactly.\n\n### Known issues\nFile extensions are often at most three characters long, so this only lints in those cases\nin an attempt to avoid false positives.\nAny extension names longer than that are assumed to likely be real path components and are\ntherefore ignored.\n\n### Example\n```rust\nfn is_markdown(path: &Path) -> bool {\n    path.ends_with(\".md\")\n}\n```\nUse instead:\n```rust\nfn is_markdown(path: &Path) -> bool {\n    path.extension().is_some_and(|ext| ext == \"md\")\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration\nThis lint has the following configuration variables:\n\n- `allowed-dotfiles`: Additional dotfiles (files or directories starting with a dot) to allow (default: `[]`)",

    "docs": "\n### What it does\nChecks for patterns that aren't exact representations of the types\nthey are applied to.\n\nTo satisfy this lint, you will have to adjust either the expression that is matched\nagainst or the pattern itself, as well as the bindings that are introduced by the\nadjusted patterns. For matching you will have to either dereference the expression\nwith the `*` operator, or amend the patterns to explicitly match against `&<pattern>`\nor `&mut <pattern>` depending on the reference mutability. For the bindings you need\nto use the inverse. You can leave them as plain bindings if you wish for the value\nto be copied, but you must use `ref mut <variable>` or `ref <variable>` to construct\na reference into the matched structure.\n\nIf you are looking for a way to learn about ownership semantics in more detail, it\nis recommended to look at IDE options available to you to highlight types, lifetimes\nand reference semantics in your code. The available tooling would expose these things\nin a general way even outside of the various pattern matching mechanics. Of course\nthis lint can still be used to highlight areas of interest and ensure a good understanding\nof ownership semantics.\n\n### Why is this bad?\nIt isn't bad in general. But in some contexts it can be desirable\nbecause it increases ownership hints in the code, and will guard against some changes\nin ownership.\n\n### Example\nThis example shows the basic adjustments necessary to satisfy the lint. Note how\nthe matched expression is explicitly dereferenced with `*` and the `inner` variable\nis bound to a shared borrow via `ref inner`.\n\n```rust\n// Bad\nlet value = &Some(Box::new(23));\nmatch value {\n    Some(inner) => println!(\"{}\", inner),\n    None => println!(\"none\"),\n}\n\n// Good\nlet value = &Some(Box::new(23));\nmatch *value {\n    Some(ref inner) => println!(\"{}\", inner),\n    None => println!(\"none\"),\n}\n```\n\nThe following example demonstrates one of the advantages of the more verbose style.\nNote how the second version uses `ref mut a` to explicitly declare `a` a shared mutable\nborrow, while `b` is simply taken by value. This ensures that the loop body cannot\naccidentally modify the wrong part of the structure.\n\n```rust\n// Bad\nlet mut values = vec![(2, 3), (3, 4)];\nfor (a, b) in &mut values {\n    *a += *b;\n}\n\n// Good\nlet mut values = vec![(2, 3), (3, 4)];\nfor &mut (ref mut a, b) in &mut values {\n    *a += b;\n}\n```",

If the\n`Err`-variant further up the call-stack stores the `Err`-variant in\nquestion (as library code often does), it itself needs to be at least\nas large, propagating the problem.\n\n### Known problems\nThe size determined by Clippy is platform-dependent.\n\n### Examples\n```rust\npub enum ParseError {\n    UnparsedBytes([u8; 512]),\n    UnexpectedEof,\n}\n\n// The `Result` has at least 512 bytes, even in the `Ok`-case\npub fn parse() -> Result<(), ParseError> {\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\nshould be\n```rust\npub enum ParseError {\n    UnparsedBytes(Box<[u8; 512]>),\n    UnexpectedEof,\n}\n\n// The `Result` is slightly larger than a pointer\npub fn parse() -> Result<(), ParseError> {\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration\nThis lint has the following configuration variables:\n\n- `large-error-threshold`: The maximum size of the `Err`-variant in a `Result` returned from a function (default: `128`)",
