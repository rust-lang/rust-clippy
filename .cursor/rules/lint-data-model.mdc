# lint-data-model

## Core Lint State Model
- Tracks lint metadata including name, description, level (deny/warn/allow)
- Maintains contextual relationships between lints and their diagnostics
- Special handling for edition-specific lint configurations
- Enforces lint deprecation policies through staged transitions

## Lint Category Hierarchies
- Implements layered categorization for lints:
  - Style (code formatting/convention violations)  
  - Correctness (potential runtime errors)
  - Complexity (code structure issues)
  - Performance (inefficient patterns)
  - Restriction (banned patterns/code constructs)
  - Pedantic (best practice violations)
  - Nursery (new/unstable lints)

## Configuration Management  
- Handles configuration hierarchies and inheritance
- Implements context-aware configuration application based on file paths
- Manages per-crate and per-module lint configurations
- Supports nested configuration overrides with precedence rules

## Diagnostic Relationship Model
- Maps lints to compiler diagnostic codes
- Tracks diagnostic severities and suggested fixes
- Manages related diagnostic notes and explanations
- Handles diagnostic suppression chains
