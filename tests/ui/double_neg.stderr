error: `--x`, which is a double negation of `x` and not a pre-decrement operator as in C/C++. Rust does not have unary increment (++) or decrement (--) operators at the moment

   = note: `-D clippy::double-neg` implied by `-D warnings`
   = help: consider using `x -= 1` if you intended to decrease the value of `x`

error: aborting due to previous error
