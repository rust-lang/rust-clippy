### What it does

Checks for jumps to the start of a stream that implements `Seek`
and uses the `seek` method providing `Start` as parameter.

### Why is this bad?

Readability. There is a specific method that was implemented for
this exact scenario.

### Example
```
fn foo<T: io::Seek>(t: &mut T) {
    t.seek(io::SeekFrom::Start(0));
}
```
Use instead:
```
fn foo<T: io::Seek>(t: &mut T) {
    t.rewind();
}
```
