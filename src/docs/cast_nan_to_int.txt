### What it does
Checks for a known NaN float being cast to an integer

### Why is this bad?
NaNs are cast into zero, so one could simply use this and make the
code more readable. The lint could also hint at a programmer error.

### Example
```
let _: (0.0_f32 / 0.0) as u64;
```
Use instead:
```
let _: = 0_u64;
```
