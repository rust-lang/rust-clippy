### What it does

Warn of cases where `let...else` could be used

### Why is this bad?

`let...else` provides a standard construct for this pattern
that people can easily recognize. It's also more compact.

### Example

```
let v = if let Some(v) = w { v } else { return };
```

Could be written:

```
let Some(v) = w else { return };
```
